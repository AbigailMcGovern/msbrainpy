# New Structure Ideas
## Associated with the beginings of the brainseries subpackage

### msbrainpy
* brainseries - processing & alignent for series of 2D images
* brainvolume - processing & alignment for lightsheet volumes (include original code here)
* query - obtaining brain data from various databases 
(currently called atlas, many data wrangling functions, need to combine i)
* atlased - implement chosen analyses on experimental and open data

Old volume code will be moved to brainvolume 

# Other plans
* pytests
* convert to cammel case (wrote script)
* check PEP8 compliance
